    "## VII. CONCLUSION <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:justified;text-indent:15px;\"> In this project, we have developed a simple, audio-based system that automatically estimates the fingering of a note played on an acoustic guitar. Building on theoretical results, we investigated several phenomena related to vibrating strings and different frequency-domain characteristics of guitar tones. We took a look at spectral estimation techniques, in order to develop a method that estimates accurately the inharmonicity constant. The latter was then used as a standalone feature for the fingering estimation task. </div><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:justified;\"> The results obtained with our system are however mixed. Even though the number of misclassification was fairly small for some strings, it reached almost 40 percent for one string. The reason is that the estimated inharmonicities of two strings (second and third) were very close, making the distinction between the two very hard. </div><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:justified;\"> Our simple system also has several limitations. First, we based our decisions solely on the inharmonicity phenomenon, and did not take a look at other audio features. As we have seen, an imprecise estimated inharmonicity will yield a misclassification. Second, the system has been trained on half of the dataset, corresponding to 390 recordings. It is not really realistic to require this large number of training examples for a practical system. </div><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:justified;\"> Future work should first focus on a more robust partial tracking method, in order to improve the accuracy of inharmonicity estimation. Another interesting direction is to investigate the potential of other audio features, such as the time envelope, the partials amplitudes, and other quantities, in distinguishing different fingerings. </div>\n",
