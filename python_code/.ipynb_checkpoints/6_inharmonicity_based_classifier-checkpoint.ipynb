    "## VI. TRAINING A SIMPLE INHARMONICITY-BASED CLASSIFIER <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:justified;text-indent:10px\"> On a guitar tuned to standard tuning, one can play notes from E2 (82.4 Hz, 6th string, open) to E5 (659.3 Hz, 1st string, fretted at the 12th position), if we restrict ourselves to the first 12 frets. From the geometry of the guitar, each note in the above range can only be played at a finite number of positions, typically up to 3. Thus, for each fundamental frequency $f_0$ in the range [82.4, 659.3] we have a list of pairs $\\{(n_i, p_i)\\}_{i \\in I}$ that represents all possible fingerings for this particular $f_0$. The elements of these pairs are the string number $n_i$ (between 1 and 6) and the fretboard position $p_i$ (between 0 and 12). Therefore, the fingering estimation reduces to a classification problem. </div><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:justified;\"> In the previous chapter, we developed a method to track the partials of a monophonic guitar sound in successive time frames and to estimate the corresponding inharmonicity coefficient $\\hat{B}$. Assembling all the tools we have seen, we now construct a simple inharmonicity-based classifier. The resulting system may be seen as a one-feature classifier: it decided which fingering was used only using the estimated inharmonicity. In order to do this, let us first define a measure that only depends on the string rather than the particular position being used. We consider a new constant $\\gamma$ given by </div><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\gamma = BL^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2 E S K^2}{T}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><div style=\"text-align:justified;\"> $\\gamma$ only depends on string properties (elastic modulus $E$, cross-sectional area $S$, radius of gyration $K$ and tension $T$). The idea is now to learn the 6 constants $\\gamma_1$ to $\\gamma_6$ from data. </div><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:justified;\"> Our dataset consists of 780 recordings (10 per position, up to the 12th fret on each of the 6 strings) of isolated notes, in the range E2-E5. We used a Washburn D10 Dreadnought acoustic guitar directly plugged into an audio interface M-audio M-track 8 to perform all the recordings. We divide these recordings into training recordings (forming the training set) and test recordings (forming the test set). We chose a 50-50 train-test split, i.e 50% of the recordings are used for training and 50% for testing. We now describe the training and testing procedures in more details. </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Training procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given all the training recordings of a fingering $(n_i, p_i)$, we use our inharmonicity estimation method to estimate the inharmonicity constant $\\hat{B}_{(n_i, p_i)}$ of that fingering. We have to choose which method we want to use (either the average or the polynomial fit, with either Goertzel or MUSIC).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given all the estimated inharmonicity constants $\\hat{B}_{(n_i, p_i)}$ for one string, we can then compute the corresponding constant gamma as an average, \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\hat{\\gamma}_i = \\frac{1}{13} \\sum_{m = 0}^{12} \\hat{B}_{(n_i, p_m)} L^2_m.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once this learning phase is done, we have at our disposal 6 constants $\\gamma_1$ to $\\gamma_6$, representing the \"inharmonicity profiles\" of each string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Testing procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a test recording, we first process it in the same fashion as the training recordings: we estimate the fundamental, split it into frames, track the partials in all the frames, and finally estimate the inharmonicity $\\hat{B}_{test}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- For all potential fingering candidates $\\{(n_i, p_i)\\}_{i \\in I}$ of the estimated $f_0$, we compare the estimated inharmonicity coefficient $\\hat{B}_{test}$ to the $\\{\\gamma_i / L_i^2\\}_{i \\in I}$, where $\\gamma_i$ is the corresponding string inharmonicity profile and $L_i$ the string length corresponding to the fretboard position $p_i$. The best candidate, i.e the one with the closest inharmonicity coefficient, is declared to be the fingering that was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This testing procedure is repeated for all the test recordings. Our performance measure will be the number of misclassifications. In our context, a misclassification is defined as a fingering estimated incorrectly."

We chose to consider the first 1.5 seconds of each recording, and the first 8 partials in frames of .75 seconds. The reason is that higher order partials are more volatile and harder to track. We used our modified Goertzel's algorithm to track the partials, as it was much faster and showed a more stable behavior. As we can see, the second method (polynomial fit) yields much better results. </div><br />\n",

The number of misclassifications observed with the best method is still very high for the second and third strings (26 and 15 errors, respectively) and can be explained by the proximity of the two estimated constants $\\hat{\\gamma_2}$ and $\\hat{\\gamma_3}$. For these two, a slight imprecision in the inharmonicity estimation of a test recording will lead to a misclassification. </div>"
